I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I have broad interests in theoretical computer science, especially in designing space- and time-efficient data structures. 

During the spring of 2025, I had a great time visiting [William Kuszmaul](https://sites.google.com/site/williamkuszmaul) at CMU.
